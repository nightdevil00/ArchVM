A collection of scripts that allows me to re-install Archlinux using btrfs with luks2 encryption, install better fonts and improve fonts rendering, install yay and google chrome, install a list of AUR packages, export installed packages...
I plan to also create a script to allow for custom ISOs built with archiso and themes for plymouth and GRUB.
